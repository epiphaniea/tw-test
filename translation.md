# Script editor

When developing and maintaining scripts, developers define the dialog structure as a set of states and their allowed transitions.

## Dialog description

The platform provides a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for specifying dialog states and transition rules. For complex business logic, developers can use JavaScript code snippets and Kotlin projects.

The platform can process responses to external events and receive data from external systems. For example, it can authenticate against external services or offer a payment dialog that accepts payment status.

## Web-based script editor

The platform provides a web interface for editing scripts and associated files: tests, reference materials, and more. The web interface highlights script syntax and automatically corrects syntax errors when using patterns.

## Visual script editor

The platform provides a graphical tool for creating, editing, and exploring a script's structure and properties of individual blocks.

The visual editor:

- Displays the structure of a chatbot script.
- Enables automatic code generation for standard blocks and configuration of their properties.
